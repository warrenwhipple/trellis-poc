# Desktop App Release Script
# Based on apps/desktop/RELEASE.md
#
# Usage:
#   ./create-release.sh <version> [--publish]
#   Example: ./create-release.sh 0.0.1
#   Example: ./create-release.sh 0.0.1 --publish
#
# This script will:
# 1. Verify prerequisites (clean git, GitHub CLI authenticated)
# 2. Delete existing release/tag if republishing same version
# 3. Update package.json version
# 4. Create and push a git tag to trigger the release workflow
# 5. Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow in real-time
# 6. Leave release as draft (default) or auto-publish with --publish flag
#
# Features:
# - Supports republishing: Running with same version will clean up and rebuild
# - Draft by default for review before publishing
# - Use --publish flag to auto-publish when build completes
#
# Requirements:
# - GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated
# - Clean working directory
# - Running from monorepo root
